# Autonomous Truck and Trailer Parking In Carla Sim

This project was completed as part of the Deep Reinforcement Learning course at Carnegie Mellon University. The goal was to use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to park a truck and trailer in a hyper-realistic simulation environment. Due to the complex non-linear dynamics of the system, we employed Behvaiour Cloning on human collected expert trajectories, as well as a curriculum training method.
